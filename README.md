# ft_services

## Description
* This is a System Administration and Networking project.

* Ft_services will introduce you to Kubernetes. You will discover cluster management and deployment with Kubernetes. You will virtualize a network and do "clustering".

You will discover cluster deployment and management with Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a system for running thousands of containers in an automated, declarative, repeatable, and understandable way. It's how the biggest tech companies in the world run their web services.
I will be providing some reference materials for you to use as you progress throughout exploring the world of k8s so that you can keep the complete Kubernetes picture in front of you as we cover each individual concept.

### Components

- ```MetalLB```: Is a Load Balancer that manages external access to its services. It is the only entrance to the cluster.

- ```Nginx```: Is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

- ```vsFTPd```: [very secure FTP daemon] Is an FTP server for Unix-like system, including Linux.

- ```MariaDB```: Is a database management system derived from MySQL with a GPL (General Public License).

- ```Wordpress```: Is a CMS(Content Managament System) focused on the creation of any type of web page.

- ```phpMyAdmin```: Is a free software tool intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the web.

- ```InfluxDB```: Is a open-source time series database developed by InfluxData

- ```Telegraf```: Is the open-source server agent to help you collect metrics from your stacks, sensors and systems.

- ```Grafana```: Is a open-source graphing and analisys software. Allows you to query, view, alert, and explore your metrics from Time Series Database Storage(TSDB)

### Technologies

- ```Docker```: Is a open-source project that automates the deployment of applications within software containers.

- ```Kubernetes```: Is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and handling of containerized applications.

- ```Minikube```: Is a Kubernetes utility that runs a Kubernetes cluster on your machine.

- ``` Kubectl```: is the command line application that lets you interact with your Minikube Kubernetes cluster.

- ```VirtualBox```: Is a generic tool for running virtual machines. It runs other operating systems—Ubuntu, Windows, etc.—inside your host operating system.

- ```Alpine Linux```: Is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox, which aims to be lightweigth and secure by default.
